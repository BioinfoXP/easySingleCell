Description: An AI-powered tool for retrieving and curating datasets from the 
    NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). It utilizes Retrieval-Augmented 
    Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate 
    natural language into precise Boolean queries, scrape metadata in parallel, 
    and score dataset relevance based on user-defined clinical contexts 
    (e.g., tissue type, responder status). Results are exported with 
    automated scoring and formatting.
